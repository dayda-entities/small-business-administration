This inventory is the first phase in the development of a single repository of all completed and planned research and evaluation projects that have or will be conducted by DOL in the upcoming calendar year. This data set includes: a title and description of each project; the date the project began; the date the project was published with a link to completed research and evaluation project outcomes as these become available; and, information on Contract or Grant resources, if applicable. The database will be updated on a monthly basis to add more agency information and to links to completed projects.
