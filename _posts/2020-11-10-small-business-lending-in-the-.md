The Office of Advocacy annually publishes Small Business Lending in the United States, which provides information on the lending activities of depository lenders. Data used in the analysis come from the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) and the reports required under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The data cover savings banks, savings and loan associations, and commercial banks. Geographically, the report covers the U.S territories, the District of Columbia and all the states. The Small and Micro Business Lending tables use the call report data to rank all lenders by state.
